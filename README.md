<b>maestro_testing.py</b> is supposed to execute 3 other scripts in parallel (<b> printing1.py, printing2,py, printing3.py </b>).
But the issue, as seen in the output text file, is that they execute concurrently.

GeoPortal_UI.py is supposed to be the actual implementation and will replace maestro_testing.py once I figure out how to fix it.
