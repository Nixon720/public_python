<b>maestro_testing.py</b> is supposed to execute 3 other scripts in parallel (<b> printing1.py, printing2,py, printing3.py </b>).
But the issue, as seen in the output text file, is that they execute concurrently.

<b>GeoPortal_UI.py</b> is supposed to be the actual implementation and will replace <b>maestro_testing.py</b> once I figure out how to fix it.
